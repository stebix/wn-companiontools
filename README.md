# Companion Toolkit


## Introduction

This repository is a collection of companion tooling for our `woodnet` deep learning pipeline and paper project.
It encompasses three main purposes:
- provide visualization code for rendering volumetric scans from the described advanced sub-$\mathrm{\mu}$-CT imaging modality
- provide download helper code to collect accompaniying data from the Zenodo upload
- demo code for performing an automated prediction ðŸ¤–

## Installation

You can first pull the repository to a location of your desire.
```bash
git pull INSERTHERE
```
Then - assuming the current working directory is the pulled repository - install the code via `pip` in editable mode.
```bash
pip install --editable .
```

## Further Information

If you are interested in wood science and the application of advanced computed tomography imaging and deep learning to it, you may find our paper manuscript (TODO: LINK) and the [`woodnet`]() pipeline implementation useful.
